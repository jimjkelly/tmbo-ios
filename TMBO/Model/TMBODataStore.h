/**
 `TMBODataStore` offers a simple programmatic interface to reading and writing data on TMBO.
 
 ## Local caching
 
 The `TMBODataStore` singleton caches relevant data locally for fast access between application launches. This data is pruned automatically to maintain a low impact on local nonvolatile memory.
 
 ## Asynchronous fetching
 
 Data is fetched from the server asynchronously, and methods of this class follow a simple naming convention to indicate their functionality:
 
 - Methods beginning in `cached` fetch their data from the local Core Data model and return it synchronously. Their results may be empty/nil.
 - Methods beginning in `set` affect the local data state immediately, and spawn an asynchronous operation to push the change to the server.
 - All other methods take a completion block that is passed the result and an NSError as parameters.
 
 Note that the methods taking completion blocks will call them on any thread. If you need to interact with UI in your completion block, you should nest a `dispatch_async()` within it, targeting the main thread (`dispatch_get_main_queue()`)
 
 ## Development notes
 
 When DEBUG is defined, the model will fail fast and hard wherever possible. If a data getter/setter method is called and there is no token, an exception will be thrown. If `-updateUploadsWithType:inRange:completion:` is called with a range of uploads that is not within the set of uploads cached locally, an exception will be thrown.
